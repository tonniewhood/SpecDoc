\subsection{System Requirements}

\subitem{
    The System provides the hardware and software foundation for all onboard modules. It includes processing, hardware capabilities, interfaces, hardware abstraction, and power management. The System is comprised of five main parts: Processing, Built in HW Capabilities, HW Interfaces, HAL, and Power Management.
}

% \subsubsection{Interfaces}
% \paragraph{Inputs}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Waypoints are defined as a time index series of LLA points. Waypoints do not require an orientation or velocity component to avoid
%             overconstraining the Planner submodule.
%     \item RC inputs are defined as the literal signals received from the RC receiver. This includes the raw stick inputs, as well as any auxiliary channels.
%             The layout of these channels will be defined in the configuration parameters for a specific transmitter.
%     \item External sensor data is defined as raw data received from any sensors not directly connected to the onboard PCB. This includes sensors
%             connected via serial communication.
% \end{enumerate}
% \paragraph{Outputs}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Peripheral commands are defined as commands to control onboard motors and servos. These commands are generated by the Controller submodule.
% \end{enumerate}
% \paragraph{Internal}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item UAV state estimates are defined as the best estimate of the UAV's current position, orientation, velocity, and angular velocity. This estimate is generated by the Navigation submodule.
%     \item Desired states are defined as a time index series of the positions, orientations, velocities, and angular velocities. These desired states are generated by the Planner submodule.
%     \item State mask is defined as a bitmask indicating which states are to be controlled by the Controller submodule, and is generated by the Planner submodule.
%     \item RC adjustments are defined as trims and scaling factors for each control input. Based on the transmitter mapping, the adjusments will be applied to the raw RC inputs and passed to the Logger for logging. These adjustments are generated by the Planner submodule.
%     \item Raw control outputs are defined as the initial values calculated by the Controller for percent thrust, aileron deflection, elevator deflection, and rudder deflection. These values aren't directly used, but are passed to the Logger for logging purposes.
%     \item Error reports are defined as any fault or error detected by the HAL or Planner, Navigation, or Controller submodules during operation. These reports are passed to the Logger for logging and potential transmission. Error reports shall include a timestamp, error code, and description of the error.
%     \item Onboard sensor data is defined as raw data received from any sensors directly connected to the onboard PCB.
% \end{enumerate}
