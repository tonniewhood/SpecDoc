\subsection{Logger}

\subitem{
    The Logger records mission data and provides mechanisms for transmission or storage by collecting telemetry, writing to storage, and/or sending data via communications links. The Logger is comprised of two submodules: Storage and Transmitt. Each submodule handles data persistence and transmission for mission telemetry and diagnostic information.
}

\subsubsection{Interfaces}
\paragraph{Inputs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Logger configuration parameters
    \item Logs from the Navigation submodule as defined in \S3.2.1.2.2
    \item Logs from the Planner submodule as defined in \S3.3.1.2.3
    \item Logs from the Controller submodule as defined in \S3.4.1.2.2
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Outputs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Log files
    \item Telemetry packets
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{General Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Logger shall support logging of all generated data from the Navigation, Planner, and Controller submodules.
    \item The Logger configuration parameters shall contain at least a default log file location, log file format, sliding window parameters for stored logs, transmission targets and protocols, and logging rate limits.
    \item The Logger shall support rate limiting for all logged data controled by a configuration parameter as defined in \S3.5.2.1.
    \item The Logger shall adhere to all coding standards defined under \S3.1.1.7 and \S3.1.5.
    \item The Logger shall use no more than 10\% of the total CPU time allocated to the onboard software system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Storage}
\subitem{
    The Storage submodule is responsible for persisting telemetry and logs to onboard non-volatile memory,
    ensuring data is retained for later retrieval and analysis. The location and format of stored data can be defined
    via configuration parameters. However, if no configuration is provided, the Storage submodule will default to storing data in
    a predefined location in a standard format as defined in the proceeding requirements.
}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Storage submodule shall save all log files to a configurable directory on non-volatile memory.
    \item The Storage submodule shall support a sliding window in which to save log files based on either time duration or storage size limits determined by the Logger configuration parameters defined in \S3.5.2.1.
    \item The Storage submodule shall implement a verification mechanism such as checksums or hashes for all stored data.
    \item The Storage submodule shall use no more than 5\% of the total CPU time allocated to the onboard software system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Transmitt}
\subitem{
    The Transmitt submodule handles transmission of selected telemetry data to ground stations or
    other external systems via available communications links.
}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Transmitt submodule shall support transmission to up to three external systems simultaneously.
    \item The Transmitt submodule shall be support communication through UDP as defined in RFC 768 - User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
    \item The Transmitt submodule shall be support communication through TCP as defined in RFC 9293 - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    \item The Transmitt submodule shall use no more than 5\% of the total CPU time allocated to the onboard software system.
\end{enumerate}
