% \subsection{Verification Methods}
% 	Possible verification methods include:
% 	\bigskip
	
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item Inspection:\\

% 	Inspection is a method of verification consisting of investigation, 
% 	without the use of special laboratory appliances or procedures, to 
% 	determine compliance with requirements. Inspection is generally 
% 	nondestructive and includes (but is not limited to) visual examination, 
% 	manipulation, gauging, and measurement.

% 		\item Demonstration:\\

% 	Demonstration is a method of verification that is limited to readily 
% 	observable functional operation to determine compliance with 
% 	requirements. This method shall not require the use of special equipment 
% 	or sophisticated instrumentation.
	
% 		\item Analysis:\\

% 	Analysis is a method of verification, taking the form of the processing of 
% 	accumulated results and conclusions, intended to provide proof that 
% 	verification of a requirement has been accomplished. The analytical 
% 	results may be based on engineering study, compilation or interpretation 
% 	of existing information, similarity to previously verified requirements, 
% 	or derived from lower level examinations, tests, demonstrations, or 
% 	analyses.


% 		\item Direct Test:

% 	Test is a method of verification that employs technical means, including (but not 
% 	limited to) the evaluation of functional characteristics by use of special equipment
% 	or instrumentation, simulation techniques, and the application of established 
% 	principles and procedures to determine compliance with requirements.
